<h1>NDA-PHI</h1>

<p>
    All patient Protected Health Information (PHI—which includes patient medical and financial
    information), employee records, financial and operating data of the practice, and any other
    information of a private or sensitive nature are considered confidential. Confidential information
    should not be read or discussed by any employee unless pertaining to his or her specific job
    requirements. Examples of inappropriate disclosures include :

</p>

<ul>
    <li>Employees discussing or revealing PHI or other confidential information to friends or family
        members.
    </li>
    <li>Employees discussing or revealing PHI or other confidential information to other employees
        without a legitimate need to know.
    </li>
    <li>The disclosure of a patient’s presence in the office, hospital, or other medical facility, without
        the patient’s consent, to an unauthorized party without a legitimate need to know, and that
        may indicate the nature of the illness and jeopardize confidentiality.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The unauthorized disclosure of PHI or other confidential information by employees can subject each
    individual employee and the practice to civil and criminal liability. Disclosure of PHI or other
    confidential information to unauthorized persons, or unauthorized access to, or misuse, theft,
    destruction, alteration, or sabotage of such information, is grounds for immediate disciplinary action
    up to and including termination.
</p>
